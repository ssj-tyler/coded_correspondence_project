# coded_correspondence_project
A Codecademy project dealing with strings and cryptography, from July 2022.

This was a project I had attempted earlier in my learning experience but was unable to figure out at the time. It deals with the Caesar and Vigenere ciphers and how they work to encrypt and decrypt strings in Python. With online resources I was able to figure out this project much easier, as working with strings is admittedly a weakness of mine - I'm much better with numbers. I wonder if this is related to me being better able to work with instrumental music but not lyrics as a musician? On the other hand, one of the decoded Ceasar messages in the project I was able to figure out the shift just by looking at it so who knows...?
